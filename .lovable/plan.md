# Plan: Trade Generator UX Refactoring

## ✅ Completed

All tasks from the previous plan have been implemented:

1. **Risk Surface relocated to Step 2 (Quant Validation)** - No longer a standalone "hero" element
2. **"Powered by" explanatory texts added** - Step 1 (GPT-4/Macro) and Step 2 (Deep Learning/Monte Carlo)
3. **TradeSetupCard context UX improved** - Context now visible by default with truncation and "Read more" toggle
4. **Risk Notes visible directly** - Rose-colored warning style for immediate visibility
5. **Technical Levels collapsible renamed** - Supports/Resistances in dedicated "Technical Levels" section

No regressions introduced. All functionality preserved.
